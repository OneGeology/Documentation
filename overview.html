<h2>OneGeology Technical Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#onegeology-technical-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are two main areas being covered; first is how to use OneGeology and second (the major part) is how to provide services for OneGeology. Currently there is a bit of overlap in general OneGeology introductory type of material in the “cookbook” sections and other pages on the onegeology.org site. Other pages on the onegeology site that have overlapping content which we should consider together with cookbook content are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/what_is/home.html">http://onegeology.org/what_is/home.html</a> and all the subsections are introductions to OneGeology which we should point to where appropriate rather than duplicating.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/participants/home.html">http://onegeology.org/participants/home.html</a> is a high-level description of what it means to participate in OneGeolgy as a provider so could be pointed to from how to provide services introduction.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/home.html">http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/home.html</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/get_involved.cfm">http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/get_involved.cfm</a> are the bits participating organisations will have read and form submitted when expressing interest in becoming providers so note from service provision introduction.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/home.html">Techical overview</a> and sub-sections (<a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/users.html">http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/users.html</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/geosciml.html">http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/geosciml.html</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/portal/portal_uses.html">http://onegeology.org/portal/portal_uses.html</a>) feel like a bit of an oddity with a lot of overlap with cookbook high-level introductory content.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://onegeology.org/portal/home.html">http://onegeology.org/portal/home.html</a> - Should this page exist separately or instead be a direct link to cookbook chapter on portal?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These pages are specifically aimed at those involved in the detailed technical aspects of OneGeology and the processes required to provide your geological map data to the web. Minimum technical requirements and specifications are outlined and the levels of involvement possible are explained.</p>
<p>For a brief overview of the aims and progress of the initiative, please click ‘here &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.onegeology.org/what_is/home.html">http://www.onegeology.org/what_is/home.html</a>&gt;’_.</p>

<div class="section" id="for-non-specialists">
<h2>For non-specialists<a class="headerlink" href="#for-non-specialists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The project’s aim is to create dynamic digital geological map data for the world. This data will be made available from a portal via the Internet using the latest computing technology, GeoSciML. This approach allows different types of data and formats to be made available and will be accessible by anyone using the web.</p>
<p>There is no requirement for prior technical knowledge to be able to take part in the Initiative so please don’t be discouraged by some of the technical aspects. The Technical Implementation Group has been set up to provide a methodology and series of ‘user cookbooks’ to guide participants through the process. These step-by-step ‘cookbooks’ will take you through the process from creating digital scans of paper maps if digital GIS data is not available, to ‘serving’ it on the web via the Portal. They will be available from this website in January 2008. A system to ensure support and advice is also currently being arranged.</p>
<p>Data licensing and ownership is also an important issue that we are frequently asked about. Map data served to the Internet as part of OneGeology will remain in the ownership of the originating geological survey or organisation, and ideally be available at no cost. The format of the ‘web mapping and feature services’ will allow registry and technical references, for example. Authorship of the data can be communicated by such things as the placement of each organisation’s logo that is serving the data within their piece of the jigsaw. References will include the name of the data provider and a link to their home website. The legend for each map part of the jigsaw will be in the nation’s home language, with each nation aiming to provide an English (and/or other) alternative when possible.</p>
<p>Principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>OneGeology benefits our agencies and our users.</p></li>
<li><p>web visibility is very important.</p></li>
<li><p>each contributor decides which maps to contribute.</p></li>
<li><p>it is anticipated that the majority of contributed maps will be bedrock and/or superficial maps, lithological and/or lithostratigraphical and/or chronostratigraphical where possible, but again, each contributor decides.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The aim: One service - many uses<a class="headerlink" href="#the-aim-one-service-many-uses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Geological map data will be made available as a distributed web service, using the OGC ‘web feature mapping’ approach. The priority of OneGeology is to make available interoperable, Internet-accessible, scientifically-attributed data and to make progress at levels appropriate to participants’ capability. Surveys and organisations are encouraged to work together to develop and implement the required interchange standard to make their data interoperable. This can be achieved by using GML (Geography Mark-up Language) based
data.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/gml_based_data.jpg"><img alt="GML-Based data" src="_images/gml_based_data.jpg" style="width: 417px; height: 249px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">GML Based Data</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p>GML based data (including ‘GeoSciML&lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cgi-iugs.org/tech_collaboration/geosciml.html">http://www.cgi-iugs.org/tech_collaboration/geosciml.html</a>&gt;_) can be used in many different ways.
For example, basic data can be rendered into a map that can be interrogated for further detailed information, the data can be formatted into a report, or it can be used in other applications for further development.</p>

<div class="section" id="map-specifications">
<h2>Map specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#map-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Prerequisites for OneGeology involvement:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the target scale is 1:1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 but the project will be pragmatic and accept a range of scales and the best available data.</p></li>
<li><p>to provide a WMS you only require a georeferenced scanned paper map or raster or vector digital GIS data.</p></li>
<li><p>to provide feature and complex data queries via GeoSciML based WFS you</p>
<ul>
<li><p>need to map from your GIS (ESRI ARCINFO, MapInfo, ORACLE etc.) data store to WFS server configuration (Geoserver or Mapserver/Cocoon).</p></li>
<li><p>need a (trained) person week, but includes getting WFS going with open source software (IT issues).</p></li>
<li><p>should note that the mapping process will be simple (small part of GeoSciML) if the themes chosen by the geological specification group are simple e.g. simple polygons with few attributes such as bedrock, lithology and age.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WMS = web map service &amp;#x2014; this is level 1, the minimum for OneGeology
WFS = web feature service, this holds more detailed data.</p>

<h3>Level 1 involvement with OneGeology web services<a class="headerlink" href="#level-1-involvement-with-onegeology-web-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Geological surveys and similar institutions that wish to contribute to the OneGeology initiative at Level 1 are aiming to provide an <strong>OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS)</strong> from a web server within their organisation, or hosted by a neighbouring organisation, of some basic geological maps.</p>
<p>The maps will appear in the computer users application, which may be a web browser, in a raster or image form. Such image maps will be combinable with other spatial datasets depending on the application the user wishes to apply. If the data that is the source behind the WMS is of digital vector data form with attributes associated with those vectors e.g. information attached to a particular type polygon or boundary then the WMS will allow the display of such attributes for each polygon. If the data source behind the WMS is of a simple scanned raster type e.g. scanned from a paper map and served as a raster image, then such attributes or further informa0tion do not exist for separate polygons.</p>

<p>Geological surveys and similar institutions that wish to contribute to the OneGeology initiative at Level 2 are aiming to provide an <strong>OGC Web Feature Service (WFS)</strong> from a web server within their organisation, or hosted by a neighbouring organisation, of some basic geological ‘map’ data.</p>
<p>These WFS will allow the user to download data in GeoSciML form resulting from queries (geographic or other attribute based) of the data over the web so that the same query could be sent to some/all of the OneGeology contributors WFS services around the world.</p>
