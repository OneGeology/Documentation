            :class: technical_progress_side_menu

         The following table is derived from the OneGeology-Europe WP5
         and WP6 guidelines for preparing the datasets. **The table is
         provided to assist those organizations that already have data
         mapped to the OneGeology-Europe data model and wish to update
         their services to use the same data for a GeoSciML-Portrayal
         4.0 WMS service that will be INSPIRE conformant.**

         When reading the table you should generally (such as excluding
         headers) consider pairs of rows, where the  first row  refers
         to the OneGeology-Europe data mapping (label, required status,
         and description) and  the second row  is the corresponding
         mapping in a GeoSciML-Portayal record. Descriptions that have a
         line through them are regarded as obsolete (that is, refer to
         the OneGeology-Europe data mapping that is either replaced or
         not required in GeoSciML-Portrayal).

         Generally you should note that URNs are deprecated and replaced
         by HTTP-URIs, whether they be INSPIRE URIs, or CGI URIs.

         We also provide some Excel spreadsheets (below) that map the
         OneGeology-Europe URNs to their equivalent HTTP-URIs for both
         the INSPIRE and CGI controlled vobabularies, that is:

  CompositionPart in the GeologicUnit as a whole; and the proportion of
  the CompositionPart in the GeologicUnit as a whole. *For example, if
  the geologic units of a given dataset have in some cases 5 distincts
  lithology, but not more, then the database (or shapefile) will have 5
  attributes lithology, role and proportion.* the main lithology

O

Metadata snippet indicating how the spatial extent of the feature was
determined. ObservationMethod is a convenience property that provides a
quick and dirty approach to observation metadata.

| The positional accurancy [numerical value]
| MappedFeature/positionalAccuracy

M

It is recommended that the same, approximate, value be given for all
MappedFeatures and will generally be around 250m for a 1:1 million scale
map.

| positionalAccuracy
| [string]

O

Preferred use is a quantitative value defining the radius of an
uncertainty buffer around a MappedFeature, e.g. a positionAccuracy of
100 m for a line feature defines a buffer polygon of total width 200 m
centered on the line. Some other text description that quantifies
position accuracy may be provided, e.g. a term from a controlled
vocabulary. Vocabulary used should be described in the dataset metadata.

| The sampling frame [urn]
| MappedFeature/samplingFrame

M

| This property should be set to
  **urn:cgi:feature:CGI:EarthNaturalSurface**
| for the surface map and **urn:cgi:feature:CGI:BedrockSurface** for the
  bedrock map

The sampling frame

There is no corresponding property in GeoSciML-Portrayal

| The geometry
| MappedFeature/shape

M

| shape
| [GM_Object]

M

Geometry defining the extent of the feature of interest. This is the
only element with complex content, and must contain a GML geome-try that
is valid for the Geography Markup Language (GML) simple features profile
(OGC 06-049r1.). The shape value will generally be provided by GIS
software, and will need no user input.

| CONTACT: *featureMember/MappedFeature/specification/Contact*
| The following data are the attributes of the geologic structure which
  the current mappedFeature is a part of

| A unique Geologic Structure ID [Any type]
| Contact id

M

Each GeologicStructure should be given a unique identifier.

A unique Geologic Structure ID

There is no corresponding property in GeoSciML-Portrayal

| The name of the geologic Structure
| Contact/name

O

Could be a simple name (text) or a urn (see the WP3 explanatory notes)

| name
| [string]

O

Display name for the Contact. Examples: ‘depositional contact’,
‘unconformity’, ‘Martin-Escabrosa contact’

| The observation method [urn]
| Contact/observationMethod

M

| either
  **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:FeatureObservationMethod:201001:data_from_single_published_description**
| where the property values are derived from a single source document,
  or
| **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:FeatureObservationMethod:201001:synthesis_of_multiple_published_descriptions**
| where they are derived from multiple source documents.

| observationMethod
| [string]

O

Metadata snippet indicating how the spatial extent of the feature was
determined. ObservationMethod is a convenience property that provides a
quick and dirty approach to observation metadata.

| The purpose
| Contact/purpose

?

For OneGeology-Europe the Purpose property should be set to :
**typical_norm**.

**CONTACT TYPE**

| Contact Type [urn]
| Contact/contactType

?

In OneGeology-Europe Contacts are only being used to describe the linear
features delimiting impact craters and calderas. Impact craters and
calderas are not defined as polygons and the material within these
structures should be described using GeologicUnit.

-  For impact craters the Contact contactType property should be set to
   **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:ContactType:201001:impact_structure_boundary**
-  For calderas the Contact contactType property should be set to
   **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:ContactType:201001:volcanic_subsidence_zone_boundary**
-  For glacial stationary lines the Contact contactType property should
   be set to
   **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:ContactType:201001:glacial_stationary_line**
-  You may also wish to give the glacial stationary line a name (see WP3
   Explanatory notes)

| contactType_uri
| [string]

M

URI referring to a controlled concept from a vocabulary defining the
Contact types. Mandatory property - if no value is provided then a URI
referring to a controlled concept explaining why the value is nil must
be provided.

| Contact Type [urn]
| Contact/contactType

?

In OneGeology-Europe Contacts are only being used to describe the linear
features delimiting impact craters and calderas. Impact craters and
calderas are not defined as polygons and the material within these
structures should be described using GeologicUnit.

-  For impact craters the Contact contactType property should be set to
   **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:ContactType:201001:impact_structure_boundary**
-  For calderas the Contact contactType property should be set to
   **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:ContactType:201001:volcanic_subsidence_zone_boundary**
-  For glacial stationary lines the Contact contactType property should
   be set to
   **urn:cgi:classifier:CGI:ContactType:201001:glacial_stationary_line**
-  You may also wish to give the glacial stationary line a name (see WP3
   Explanatory notes)

| contactType
| [string]

O

Text label specifying the kind of surface separating two geologic units
including primary boundaries such as depositional contacts, all kinds of
unconformities, intrusive contacts, and gradational contacts, as well as
faults that separate geologic units. Ideally this would be the preferred
label for the concept identified by contactType_uri

| *Contact/preferredAge/GeologicEvent*
| An age as “preferredAge” can be optionally provided for glacial
  stationary lines

| The event Age
| GeologicEvent/eventAge

M

The eventAge field should be populated as a numeric range (two
attributes) or as a single numeric value (one attribute). The age
recorded as a negative number (e.g. -250)

| The event process [urn]
| GeologicEvent/eventProcess

M

It is up to each data provider to present several event process
(therefore, several attributes with distinct names) for describing the
process that formed the geologic structure. Use the 1GE vocabulary
“\ `EventProcess <../1GE/VocabXL/1GE_EventProcess.xls>`__\ ”.

O

The event process [urn]

O

| The event environment [urn]
| GeologicEvent/eventEnvironment

O

It is up to each data provider to present zero or several event
environment (therefore, several attributes with distinct names) for
describing the environment in which theGeologicStructure was formed. Use
the 1GE vocabulary
“\ `EventEnvironment <../1GE/VocabXL/1GE_EventEnvironment.xls>`__\ ”
