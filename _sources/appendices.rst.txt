   .. rubric:: Appendix F: WMS 1.3.0 GetCapabilities response from the
      BGS OneGeology exemplar service
      :name: appendix-f-wms-1.3.0-getcapabilities-response-from-the-bgs-onegeology-exemplar-service
      :class: technical_progress_side_menu

   Below is the GetCapabilities response returned by the BGS OneGeology
   service as configured by the MapServer map file shown in `Appendix
   E`_. This response document may be obtained using the following
   requests, that is, either as a `request without version parameter`_
   like:

   ::

      http://ogc.bgs.ac.uk/cgi-bin/exemplars/BGS_Bedrock_and_Superficial_Geology/ows?
        service=WMS&
        request=GetCapabilities&

   or as a `request with version parameter`_ like:
   ::

      http://ogc.bgs.ac.uk/cgi-bin/exemplars/BGS_Bedrock_and_Superficial_Geology/ows?
        service=WMS&
        request=GetCapabilities&
        version=1.3.0&

   That is, the version parameter is omittable because the default
   service is always the highest version supported by the WMS server.

Appendix K - Recommend ESRI shapefile definitions for GeoSciML-Portrayal
=========================================================================

Because the field names in GeoSciML-Portrayal are longer than 10 characters, you will not be able to have the full attribute (column) name for many of the properties if your portrayal data is loaded into an ESRI shapefile, which can be an issue in some WMS server software. To prevent truncated names, we are providing a recommended shapefile implementation with shorter field names. Field names are abbreviated to try and leave characters that convey the full name of the field; lower camel case typographic has been used, except that fields that contain URI’s end with ‘_uri’.

To help classify your service in the portal with respect these thematic keywords you can use one or more of the optional thematic\@value style keywords in your layer metadata.

Note, terms like Geology shown in bold help to classify the terms for ease of reading, but don't imply any hierarchy.  These terms are also part of the picklist of terms.
